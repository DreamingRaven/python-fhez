        This function takes 3 lists; data, filter, and stride.
        Data is a regular multidimensional list, so in the case of a 32x32
        pixel image you would expect a list of shape (32,32,3) 3 being the RGB
        channels.
        Filter is the convolutional filter which we seek to find all windows of
        inside the data. So for data (32,32,3) a standard filter could be
        applied of shape (3,3,3).
        Stride is a 1 dimensional list representing the strides for each
        dimension, so a stride list such as [1,2,3] on data (32,32,3) and
        filter (3,3,3), would move the window 1 in the first 32 dimension,
        2 in the second 32 dim, and 3 in the 3 dimension.

        This function returns a 1D list of all windows, which are themselves
        lists.
        These windows are the same length as the number of dimensions, and each
        dimension consists of indexes with which to slice the original data to
        create the matrix with which to convolve (cross correlate).
        An example given: data.shape=(4,4), filter.shape=(2,2), stride=[1,1]
        list of windows indexes = [
            [[0, 1], [0, 1]], # first window
            [[0, 1], [1, 2]], # second window
            [[0, 1], [2, 3]], # ...
            [[1, 2], [0, 1]],
            [[1, 2], [1, 2]],

            [[2, 3], [2, 3]],
        ]

        We get the indexes rather than the actual data for two reasons:
            - we want to be able to cache this calculation and use it for
              homogenus data that could be streaming into a convolutional
              neural networks, cutting the time per epoch down.
            - we want to use pure list slicing so that we can work with non-
              standard data, E.G Fully Homomorphically Encrypted lists.
