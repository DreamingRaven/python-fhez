Python-FHEz
===========

Python-FHEz is a privacy-preserving |fhe| (FHE) and deep learning library.

|fhe|:

Deep Learning:

|dl-fig|

This library is capable of both fully homomorphically encrypting data and processing encrypted cyphertexts without the private keys, thus completely privately.

This library also supports:

* advanced serialization of cyphertext objects, for transmission over networks using marshmallow
* |section_masquerade|\ ing
* |section_hadmard_product| cyphertext branching
