"""Enqueue as computational node.

Enqueueing is the process of taking two or more arrays and stacking them
together using some meta container that encapsulates both arrays.

While the queue is still being enqueued this node will block.
Once the queue has reached the desired length, it will return the queue as a
list. This will map gradients.

Akin to: `numpy stacking
